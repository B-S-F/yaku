# Builtin libraries

PAPSR comes with a list of built-in libraries which can be used in your
scripts.

You can get the list of built-in packages by running `papsr` without any
arguments. You can do this in an autopilot script in a dummy config to
get the output of this command.

Other 3rd party libraries which are not in this list are not available for
import in your script!
