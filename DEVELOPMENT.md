# Pre-commit hooks (DRAFT / POC)
This project uses pre-commit hooks to ensure that code is formatted correctly and so on.
To install pre-commit tool run:
```bash
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```
Now the hooks will run on every commit.
See also [.pre-commit-config.yaml](./.pre-commit-config.yaml) for the configuration.
