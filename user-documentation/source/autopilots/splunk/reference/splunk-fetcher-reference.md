## Command line options

The Splunk Fetcher is a small CLI that can be used to fetch data from Splunk via a search query.
It can be called in a {{ PNAME }} workflow with the {command}`splunk-fetcher` command.
The CLI of {command}`splunk-fetcher` offers the following options (see also {command}`splunk-fetcher --help`):

When calling the CLI, you need to have the {envvar}`evidence_path` environment variable set. Moreover, if you do not provide any options, you will be prompted afterwards to provide the app name, username and password.
