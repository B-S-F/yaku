# Splunk

Splunk is a software platform that helps organizations collect, analyze, and visualize machine-generated data for monitoring and gaining insights into their systems. If you are not familiar with Splunk, you can find more information on the [official page](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/home-page.html).

Do you use Splunk for data collection and analysis and need to collect reports from there and check them before releasing the new software version? You can now easily use the Splunk Fetcher for that, which uses defined search queries to get data from a Splunk server and stores it.
