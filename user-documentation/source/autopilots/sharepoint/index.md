# SharePoint

If you are storing documents on SharePoint or want to upload your QG report
to a SharePoint site, the SharePoint autopilots are the thing you want:

* download files or folders from a SharePoint site (on-premise or cloud instance)
* filter files by path or file properties
* use custom defined SharePoint file properties
* check downloaded files for required file properties, e.g. security classes
* [planned] upload a QG report to a SharePoint site
