# ILM

**Important note:** ILM is a Bosch-specific implementation.

Do you wish to retrieve the WorkOn status for a specific SharePoint file, together with the workflow requestor and approvers? The ILM Evaluator can do that for you!

ILM (Information Lifecycle Management) is a concept for the administration and control of documents over their entire lifecycle. It supports compliance with the legal requirements of the business relevant information.

WorkOn is the platform for workflows in many areas of the Bosch Group. It handles parts of the business processes (for example, by obtaining approvals from one or more other employees). ILM can interact directly with WorkOn.
