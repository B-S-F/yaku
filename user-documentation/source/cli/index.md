# CLI

Instead of using the web interface, the {{ PNAME }} service can also be accessed from a command line application.
This is very helpful if you want to use {{ PNAME }} from another automation context, e.g. within a [GitHub Action Pipeline](https://github.com/features/actions) or a [Jenkins Pipeline Script](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/).

Before you can start, you need to [install the CLI client](installation) first.

When you have the client installed, you can follow the usage instructions below.

## Usage
