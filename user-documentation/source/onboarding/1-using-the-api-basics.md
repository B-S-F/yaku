# The API â€“ Basics

```{todo}
This file should be written in the form of a Tutorial.

There should be a single use case which is being used and referenced throughout the whole Onboarding process. The chosen use case should not require the user to change anything in any of the provided files (this is only true for this very API Tutorial, not the upcoming Tutorials which are also part of the Onboarding). However, the user should have to enter ideally 1 secret to the secrets endpoint. The purpose of the use case should be obvious to all kinds of users and it should be meaningful.
