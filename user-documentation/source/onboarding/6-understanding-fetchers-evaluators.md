# Fetchers / Evaluators

```{todo}
This file should be written in the form of an Explanation/Tutorial.

It complements the autopilot guide from before. It illustrates, what the concept of fetchers and evaluators is and introduces their specific config file and gives a simple overview of it. State, that every config file is different for all of them and mention the tutorials that exist for them, the users will learn about later.

Here, as an outcome/result, we could implement something like a step where users change something about the config file and then rerun the initial example and then get a different result.
