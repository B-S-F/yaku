-> The json-evaluator is now able to detect an empty structure, and instead of throwing an error, it returns a RED/YELLOW/GREEN answer depending on the RETURN_IF_EMPTY environment variable.
-> The log field of a check is now used to specify which field of the entry is to be logged in the finding.
-> If there are multiple breaking elements in the json, the json-evaluator can now be configured using the CONTINUE_SEARCH_ON_FAIL environment variable to return dedicated findings for each json entry that broke the check.
